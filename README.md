## Made for #GithubGameOff


[![Blow the shark down](https://img.youtube.com/vi/2rAY3X4mIe4/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/2rAY3X4mIe4)

Our concept implements the hybrid theme on both the characters and the game genre; drunk Sharkmen sailors brawl in turn-based combat until there is only one Sharkman standing!

Invite your friends (if you have any, no single player this time) and resolve your conflicts the sailor way.

# Gameplay
## Phases
Drunken Sharkmen don't multitask. Their fighting is done in 2 phases:

Planning
A 3 second countdown appears. The world moves slowly while the Sharkmen plot. During this phase they are open to player input: Up to 3 attacks are queued up, as is any movement given (left stick to move).
Action
After the Planning countdown expires the Sharkmen have 3 seconds to carry out their attacks and movement, in the order given during planning.
Be careful, drunken sailors can easily fall over!

# Upcoming Features
